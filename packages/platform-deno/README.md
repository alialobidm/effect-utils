# `@lishaduck/effect-platform-deno`

`@effect/platform-deno` is missing!
In lieu, this provides Deno-specific implementations for the abstractions
defined in [`@effect/platform`](https://npmjs.com/package/@effect/platform),
allowing you to write platform-independent code
that integrates smoothly with Deno.
